/**
 * Provides ways to encode digits in different base systems, or radixes, and decode numbers written in those bases. This
 * includes base systems such as binary ({@link #BASE2}, using just 0 and 1), octal ({@link #BASE8}, 0 through 7),
 * decimal ({@link #BASE10}, 0 through 9), hexadecimal ({@link #BASE16}, 0-9 then A-F), and the even larger
 * hexatrigesimal ({@link #BASE36}, 0 through 9 then A-Z). Of special note are the two different approaches to encoding
 * base-64 data: {@link #BASE64} is the standard format, and {@link #URI_SAFE} is the different format used when
 * encoding data for a URI (typically meant for the Internet). The newest is {@link #BASE86}, which is also the largest
 * base, and uses 0-9, A-Z, a-z, and then many punctuation characters. Even more bases can be created with
 * {@link #scrambledBase(Random)}, which when called creates a base-72 Base with randomized choices for digits;
 * this could be useful for obfuscating plain-text saved data so the average player can't read it.
 * <br>
 * Each of these base systems provides a way to write bytes, shorts, ints, and longs as variable-character-count signed
 * numbers or as fixed-character-count unsigned numbers, using {@link #signed(long)} and {@link #unsigned(long)}
 * respectively. There is only one reading method for each size of number, but it is capable of reading both the signed
 * and unsigned results, and never throws an Exception (it just returns 0 if no number could be read). Each base system
 * can also read and write floats and doubles, but only using their bit representation, treated as an int or long.

     * than the length of {@code str}, it will be clamped to be treated as {@code str.length()}. If {@code str} is null
     * or empty, this returns {@code 0.0} rather than throwing an exception. This only correctly handles decimal or
     * scientific notation formats (in a format string, "%f", "%e", and "%g" will work, but "%a" will not).
     * This can read in the format produced by {@link #decimal(double)}, {@link #scientific(double)},

     * {@link #unsigned(double)}. Use {@link #readDoubleExact} to read in signed() or unsigned() output.
