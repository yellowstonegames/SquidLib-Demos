    // GreasedRegion is a hard-to-explain class, but it's an incredibly useful one for map generation and many other
    // tasks; it stores a region of "on" cells where everything not in that region is considered "off," and can be used
    // as a Collection of Coord points. However, it's more than that! Because of how it is implemented, it can perform
    // bulk operations on as many as 64 points at a time, and can efficiently do things like expanding the "on" area to
    // cover adjacent cells that were "off", retracting the "on" area away from "off" cells to shrink it, getting the
    // surface ("on" cells that are adjacent to "off" cells) or fringe ("off" cells that are adjacent to "on" cells),
    // and generally useful things like picking a random point from all "on" cells.
    // Here, we use a GreasedRegion to store all floors that the player can walk on, a small rim of cells just beyond
    // the player's vision that blocks pathfinding to areas we can't see a path to, and we also store all cells that we

    // libGDX can use a kind of packed float (yes, the number type) to efficiently store colors, but it also uses a

    // predefined colors since SColor extends Color. SparseLayers makes heavy use of packed float colors internally,
    // but also allows Colors instead for most methods that take a packed float. Some cases, like very briefly-used
    // colors that are some mix of two other colors, are much better to create as packed floats from other packed
    // floats, usually using SColor.lerpFloatColors(), which avoids creating any objects. It's ideal to avoid creating
    // new objects (such as Colors) frequently for only brief usage, because this can cause temporary garbage objects to
    // build up and slow down the program while they get cleaned up (garbage collection, which is slower on Android).

    // of that SColor as a background and foreground when used with other colors, plus more info like the hue,
    // saturation, and value of the color. Here we just use the packed floats directly from the SColor docs, but we also
    // mention what color it is in a line comment, which is a good habit so you can see a preview if needed.

// hexadecimal float or double literals always represent numbers accurately. To contrast,
// 0.3 - 0.2 is not equal to 0.1 with doubles, because tenths are inaccurate with floats and
// doubles, and hex literals won't have the option to write an inaccurate float or double.
// There's some slightly confusing syntax used to write these literals; the 0x means the first
// part uses hex digits (0123456789ABCDEF), but the p is not a hex digit and is used to start
// the "p is for power" exponent section. In the example, I used -9 for the power; this is a
// base 10 number, and is used to mean a power of 2 that the hex digits will be multiplied by.
// Because the -9 is a base 10 number, the f at the end is not a hex digit, and actually just
// means the literal is a float, in the same way 1.5f is a float. 2.0 to the -9 is the same as
// 1.0 / Math.pow(2.0, 9.0), but re-calculating Math.pow() is considerably slower if you run it
// for every cell during every frame. Though this is most useful for negative exponents because
// there are a lot of numbers after the decimal point to write out with 0.001953125 or the like,
// it is also sometimes handy when you have an integer or long written in hexadecimal and want
// to make it a float or double. You could use the hex long 0x9E3779B9L, for instance, but to
// write that as a double you would use 0x9E3779B9p0 , not the invalid syntax 0x9E3779B9.0 .
// We use p0 there because 2 to the 0 is 1, so multiplying by 1 gets us the same hex number.
// Very large numbers can also benefit by using a large positive exponent; using p10 and p+10
// as the last part of a hex literal are equivalent. You can see the hex literal for any given
// float with Float.toHexString(float), or for a double with Double.toHexString(double) .
// SColor provides the packed float versions of all color constants as hex literals in the
// documentation for each SColor.
