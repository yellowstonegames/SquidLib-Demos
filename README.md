# SquidLib-Demos
Example games and demos using SquidLib and SquidSquad.

(And also some related demos.)

The visual-noise-based demos, which generally didn't use SquidLib, have been moved to
[NoiseDemos](https://github.com/tommyettinger/NoiseDemos).

[An example of hosted colorful noise that moved is here](https://tommyettinger.github.io/NoiseDemos/SonorousNoise/).
